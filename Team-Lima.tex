\section{Introduction}
In this section we will explore an overview of everything that is included in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the features of the Mini-Project, to serve as a guide or reference for the software developers and primarily a proposal to the client approval.

\subsection{Scope}
The Mini-Project(Publication System) is a web and Android application which will assist research leaders as well as the heads of department to keep track of the progress of different research groups.
\newline Users(UP Staff) will act as the administrators for the different research groups and provide information regarding research topics, group members, progress, etc using the web-portal.
\newline The system will only keep track of metadata and not contain any of the actual publications. The information is maintained in a database that is located on a web-server. An internet connection will be required to fetch and display the information.

\subsection{Overview}

The remainder of this document includes four more sections and is organized as follows:
\newline Section 2 describes the Vision, which basically explains what the client wants to achieve with the project and what the average user would get out of the product.Section 3 continues to discuss the background, which includes the business/ research opportunity to simplify the administration and management of documents/publications in the world of research. This section also sheds light on the problems being faced that may have led to this project being started. Section 4 presents the Architecture requirements to the reader, including the integration and quality requirements as well as the architectural constraints. Section 5 describes the Functional Requirements and captures all the functionality which would be required by the users of the system. Section 6 brings up the Open Issues which entail anything that needs to be clarified regarding the requirements as well as any irregularities/inconsistencies found in the requirements.


\newpage
\section{Vision}
\subsection{Product Functions}
The main aim of this system is to assist researchers(authors) and head of department with storing metadata of research papers(not the paper itself). In the system the users will be able to see how many papers a particular user is working on, identify which research papers are due at what time(the system will keep a daily reminder of the due date) and who are the other authors of the paper but will maintain privacy since a user won't be able to see other user's work(only going to see papers where the user co-author) unless it is the head of department or a supervisor/superuser. The system will keep a status of the paper(still working on it,submitted waiting for feedback,rejected, accepted, published or improving it after rejection).
\newline The system should be able support 100 users concurrently without any difficulties. The head of department is allowed to see everything in the system meaning everyone's work. An author is not necessarily a user of the system meaning that a person can be added as one of the authors of a certain research paper, while they are not a user of the system, the primary author is responsible of adding and removing authors for a paper and the primary author should be a user of the system.
\newline Every research paper on the system should have at least one user responsible for it. The system keeps the title of the paper, if a paper is accepted/published a link to where the actual paper is stored,if a paper is deleted in the system(by the primary author) a reason, should be provided for that termination, the type of a paper(journal, conference paper or book chapter) is also kept in the system, and the system should also keep report containing DoE Units, DoE Research Output Units, UPWeighted Research Outputs, Estimated DoE Outputs and Research Funding.

\subsection{User classes and characteristics}
\subsubsection{Head of Department}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Must be a registered user of the user of the system.
		\item There is only one head of Department, since the system is for one department.
		\item Able to see everyone's work on the system.
		\item May be an author.
		\item May add or delete papers.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Primary Author/ Leading Researcher}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Must be a registered user of the user of the system.
		\item Any number less than a hundred.
		\item Able to see only the list papers of where is authoring or co-authoring.
		\item Can add or delete papers.
		\item Can add or remove authors.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Author}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item May or may not be a user of the system.
		\item If a user able to see only the list papers of where is co-authoring.
		\item Otherwise not able to see anything in the system.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
The system will be a standalone system, it does not load any external module or library function. For the user to login to the system, they must have internet access. When a user modifies something, every other use who has access to the information needs access to its latest version. The system must run on any operating system, and it will have make use of a virtual interface for the different operating system and hardware platforms.

\newpage
\section{Background}
The system gives different authors/researchers who are working on the same paper an opportunity to be able to stay updated about the progress of the paper. The system also gives the head of department an opportunity to better supervise the staff members on the research  they are working on, since research is one of the crucial aspects of every department in the university. The system also gives the head of department an opportunity to evaluate the staff member using the report the system provides.

A correct usage of the system will yield good results in management of the department's research activity and will also provide a better way of co-authoring among different authors/users because when there is a change in the status of the paper every author and user will be made aware of the deadline.

The system will also improve the current way of storing research metadata the department uses, which is  writing everything on a spreadsheet. The system will also add other things that are not in the spreadSheet like a full report of how the whole department is performing with regards to research papers and provide a more informed way of co-authoring, since everyone working on the paper will know what is going on.

\newpage
\section{Architecture requirements}
\subsection{Access channel requirements}

There will be multiple access channels for the proposed system. Mobile/android application clients will be used to fetch data(such as the deadline dates) and integrate them into mobile device for users to easily be able to identify when their deadlines are  for. The mobile application will also allow a user to search for and identify the type of paper(journal, conference paper or book) that is being worked on as well as how many papers a user may be working on. The mobile application will also allow users to see the status of a paper(still working on it, submitted and waiting for feedback, rejected, accepted, published or improving after rejection).
Web servers will be used in order to store all the users and their details as well as all the papers that are being worked on by any particular user. These web servers will be set up such that 100 users can concurrently access the server without any difficulties. The system will also make due with browser clients that will have all the same functionality as the mobile client and allow any user to access the system where ever they may be. Both the mobile application and browser client will interact with the web server in order to gain access to any information it might need. 


\subsection{Quality requirements}


In order to create a safe and legitimate system that will meet all the specifications of the project, some system requirements such as how the system performance, security, flexiblity, maintainability, auditablity, integrability, cost and usabilty.

\subsubsection{Performance} 

The system has to responsive, and responsive enough to handle up to one hundred users and not lag, the system must also be perform in such a way that if certain authors responsible for a paper want to access it at the same time them can without the system slowing down.

\subsubsection{Security}
The most important security measure that needs to held in this system is that only U.P staff are allowed to register as users, and may be the only member who can access the link to view papers. They will either set their own usernames or use their access card numbers in place of their usernames. They will also be required to set their own passwords. This password should be at least eight characters long to make it a bit more difficult for potential hackers to gain access.If a user forgets his/her password, there will need to be a way of retrieving it or re-setting a new one. My group and I decided that an email containing a link should be sent out to a user directing them to a page whereby they will be able to set a new password. If a user also fails to get the correct password for more than three tries, the user account should be blocked for safety reasons, and the user should be sent an email following the password re-setting procedure. If system fails to allow a user back into the system, the user needs to direct an enquiry to the administative user.
The user also is given the power to remove or add authors the a paper, they may also choose to terminate the paper and should also be given access to revive that same paper that was terminated by them. Only users involved in the publication can edit a paper, this modification must be known by the other users involved in the same paper, so some system of alerting co-users about the modification. The system will also have user profiles, a user can only edit their own profile. The system also has super-users that have more control then users, they can access all publications. There are alos administrative users and control who has access the the system.The administrative users basically can  remove or add users to the system, they also fix any problems regarding users. They can also view the activities of a particular user and because of this, all user activity must be logged. The hierarchy of this system in terms of privilege is tha tadministrative users have the most priority, super-users have the more authority than users and finally authors have the least aauthority.

\subsubsection{Reliability}

Reliability for this application to work is crucial to its success. If a user wants to access a paper and it is urgent, the user must always be able to access what they have access to at all times without the system failing fetch the information the user seeks. Reliability includes keeping track of user authority, the system cannot ever loose track of what actions each user can perform on the system. Super-users must be able to do all their administrative jobs, if that could fail then they would nit be able to keep track of user activity and the application. 

\subsubsection{Flexibility}

This application should be web-based and should also have a mobile application that users can make use of when away from a desktop or laptop. The system needs to be able to run the same on all these platforms and users must be able to do the same things on the web-based application and mobile-based application. For the mobile side of things, this application needs to be able to support older versions of android mobile system, so that no matter the device is used, a user can access the application and look up what they need at all times.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

Maintenance of this application will be handled by the super-users. With just a little over one hundred users this system will have to be well maintained to be able to run things smoothly.

\subsubsection{Monitorability}

The super-users will be in charge of monitoring users activity. Since there will be a log for each users activity on the system, the super user can look at the log to see what a specific user has been doing. Everything in the system will be logged to increase the level of monitorability.

\subsubsection{Usability}

This application should be simple enough for a user to use without the user asking for assistance more than once. The system must have basic instruction, maybe given to the user on a basic pdf file that they can read and understand how to navigate the system. If users still do not have a clear perspective on how the system works they will just keep referring to the pdf.

\subsubsection{Cost}

The system being built should be complex enough to run smoothly on all devices but also it should be maintainable by students to cut costs and man hours.

\subsubsection{Integrability}

The system should be integrable to mobile devices and not just be web-based. There will be a mobile application for this system.


\subsection{Integration requirements}

The main integration channel that will be used in the system is the internet which will allow users to access the web servers either via the mobile application or the browser client. An EAI system can be used to participate in concurrent integration operations at any one time.
Security plays a vital role in the integration requirements as unauthorised authors may not see, contribute or change documents while heads of departments or supervisors have the authority to see the papers being worked on.
The integration has to be reliable as papers that are being worked on are of utmost importance and would be detrimental to all those involved in the papers if something were to happen to them. The system must keep all documents secure and accounted for.
The scalability of the system should be implemented in such a way that it does not effect the performance of the system. This means that as the number of users grow access to the servers and documents should not be slowed in any way

\subsection{Architecture constraints}

The server should be available at all times to allow all users to login at any time. There should be search functionality to allow users to navigate faster.The system will be web-based and will also built to to run on mobile devices.

\subsubsection{Web-based development}

We will be building the web-based system using HTML, CSS, and some javascript for some user side functionality. We will do all client validation using javascript to check if the user input is valid.  

\subsubsection{Server-side development}

To run the database we will be using mySQL and PHP. We will store the user profile using a mySQL database and use, and all validation will be done in PHP.


\subsubsection{Mobile application development}

To build the mobile application, we will use androidStudio(java). The mobile application should only be able to access the server when you are within the premises of the University.

\section{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It was never specified whether researchers(non-users) would be able to see the information about the publications they were involved in
	\item Still unclear whether researchers(both users and non-users) will be notified if they are removed from a research group
	\item We are not sure if a user can have multiple sessions open concurrently - if a user is already logged in on the web application, will they be able to log in using their mobile device?
	\item Will the progress be represented by a percentage / a progress bar?
	\item Does the user set the order of the authors or is it automatically set when the user inputs these into a specific document

	\item Is there an option that will be provided for how long before a deadline the user will want to receive a notification?
	\item Won't privacy be an issue if researcher(non-user) information is put up and every user - even those not in the same research group - is able to view it?
	\item Will there be different tabs for different types of publications a user is busy with? ie. screens they can switch between to check on articles, Case reports, terminated publications, etc
	\item Will there be a way that research group members can access each other's information so that they can make contact?
	\item What other applications or platforms must this system be able to integrate with?
\end{itemize}
