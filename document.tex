\section{Background}

\newpage
\section{Functional requirements and application design}
This section discusses the application functionality required by users (and other stakehodlers).

\subsection{Use case prioritization}
\subsubsection{Critical}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system needs to be able to handle 100 users concurrently and at the same time.
		\item Only University of Pretoria staff members may register to become users.
		\item Users are only allowed to see publications that they are involved in.
		\item There should be a a superuser or root accountfor the Head of Department, the superuser should beable to see all research papers that is on the system.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Important}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Users(UP staff) can add and remove authors.
		\item Users(UP staff) decide when the deadline of a reasearch paper is.
		\item Users(UP staff) can terminate a research paper and revive a terminated research paper.
		\item A user can edit the details about a research paper that they are involved in.
		\item User profiles should show the total accumulated units.
		\item The system has to log everything.
		\item Users must be able to enter historical data (previosly completed research papers).
		\item Every research paper only has one primary author.
		\item Co-authors are added and sequenced.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nice-To-Have}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There should be a checkbox that defaults users as authors for research papers that they administrate, if they are just administrating they should explicitly uncheck that they are not an author.
		\item There should be an indication of progress on research papers (progress bar/precentage indication of work done)
		\item Users should be able to search for authors if they have been stored in the system.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use case/Service Contracts}
\subsubsection{Critical}
	Handle 100 users concurrently
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item System needs to be online.
				\item Users need to connect to the system.
				\item System needs to have concurrency controls to help aid 100 users at the maximum.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item System can successfully maintain the concurrent use of 100 users.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User needs to be registered at the University of Pretoria.
				\item User needs a valid staff number from the University of Pretoria.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User that is now registered on the system may now add research projects and so forth.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	The superuser account
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions

				\item User needs to be the head of the department.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Super user can see all research papers on the system.

			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Important}
	Users can add and remove authors
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-condition
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User has to be registered on the system.
				\item User has to be the primary author on a research paper that they want to add and remove other authors to and from.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-condition
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User can add and remove authors from the research paper that they are the primary author on.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	Users decide when the deadline of a research paper is.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Users need to be registered on the system.
				\item Users need to be a primary author on a research paper for which they want to set a deadline.
				\item Deadline cannot be in the past.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Deadline is set on the research paper
				\item All co-authors are notified via email what the deadline on that research paper is.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	Users can terminate and revive a research paper
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User needs to be registered on the system.
				\item User needs to be the primary author on the research paper which needs to be terminated or revived.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The selected research paper is terminated or revived.
				\item All co-authors are notified via email that the research paper is terminated or revived.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Exceptions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Superuser also has control over any users research paper.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	Users can edit details about a research paper they are involved in
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User has to be registered on the system
				\item User has to be added to the research paper or be the primary author
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The details of the research paper can be edited by the author
				\item All co-autors can see the edited details of the research paper
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	User profiles should show the total accumulated units
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-conditions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User has to be registered on the system
				\item User needs to be involved on a research paper
			\end{itemize}
		\item Post-conditions

			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	The system has to log everyting
